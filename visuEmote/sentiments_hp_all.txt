Stepping nimbly out of Harry's\r\nreach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the\r\npillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat\r\nwriting, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though\r\nit was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.\r\n\r\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Harry ",sentiment:0.6832302354040037},{letter:25,text:"Potter mustn't be angry...
